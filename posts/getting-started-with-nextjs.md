Next.js is a popular React-based framework for building high-performance web applications. With its focus on speed, efficiency, and ease of use, Next.js has quickly become one of the most popular choices for web developers looking to create fast and responsive web pages.

## Key Features of Next.js

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: Next.js provides built-in support for server-side rendering, ensuring that your pages load quickly and provide a seamless user experience.

- **Code splitting**: With Next.js, your code is automatically split into smaller, optimized chunks, reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded and increasing performance.

- **Automatic optimization**: Next.js automatically optimizes your code for performance, reducing the amount of time it takes for your pages to load and improving the overall user experience.

- **Routing**: Next.js includes a powerful and flexible routing system, making it easy to handle multiple pages and different types of content within your application.

- **Static export**: Next.js provides an easy-to-use static export feature, allowing you to create a completely static version of your web application for better performance and easier deployment.

## Getting Started with Next.js

Getting started with Next.js is simple and straightforward. You'll need to install the Next.js CLI, create a new Next.js project, and start writing your code.

- **Install the Next.js CLI**: To get started, you'll need to install the Next.js CLI by running npm install -g next in your terminal.

- **Create a new project**: To create a new Next.js project, run next init my-project in your terminal. This will create a new Next.js project in a directory called my-project.

- **Start coding**: Once your project is set up, you can start writing your code. You can write your pages and components using standard React code, and Next.js will automatically handle the rest.
